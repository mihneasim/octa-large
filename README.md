A large number is represented as:

  number_of_digits(total) number_of_digits sign 
  digits' list

E.g.: -45567.56 will be represented as:

  7 5 1 
  4 5 5 6 7 5 6

Zero will be represented as a single one-line "0".
The included procedures can compute addition / substraction
/ multiplication with scalar / multiplication between integer large numbers.
Divqr computes quotient and remainder of division.
I also included scripts for division with two decimals in the result
and square root with two decimals (by truncation).
The scripts do not validate inputs as far as I remember.
There are also included two python scripts, one for generating input files
and one for testing purposes by comparing
different outputs with the ones provided.
